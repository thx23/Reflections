 adding notes for homework

 Some version control systems:
 	Dropbox
 	Google drive
 	Wikipedia    - all have versioning built in


When to commit?
	It's easier to understand what each commit does if each only does one thing and is fairly small. Going a week without committing is not the best idea.

Donâ€™t clutter your history with typo fixes.

All the work is on a single feature, so the commit will have a clear logical purpose. After an hour, the diff will probably have a fair amount of content in it, but not too much to understand.

If bug fixes are related, commit them together.  Else, separately.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?  Version control allows a user to revert files to a previous version so they can make changes without having to worry about losing work that had been done.
