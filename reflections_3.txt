When would you want to create a remote repo rather than keeping all your work locally?

- If more than one person will be using the files
- If using more than one computer
- To ensure files are backed up on another device

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-  maybe you need to work with an older version of a file in the repository until you get your changes made to the file that you're working on

- so that it doesn't stomp on changes that you're making to a file in the repo

- so you can resolve conflicts when you're ready to work on them


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- forking happens on Github which is basically cloning another Github repository
- clone a repository that existes in my Github profile
	- it may have been forked from another repo or it may have been added by myself
- branch occurs locally
